# Chinese_Poetry_Bilingual
### what is the definition of this repository?
A database for Chinese Poetry in json format
 with Chinese and English version.


### Why I want to build this database?
Mainly inspired by the high-stared repository
 <i>chinese-poetry</i>, the author of which aims 
 to provide chinese users an quick way to get 
 exposed to traditional Chinese culture. 
 Then, it occurs to me that why not build a similar 
 database, but in English? According to my experience, I notice 
 a lot of native English like to pick some Chinese culture sentences
 during their conversation.
 Hence, here comes this repository.
 This repository focuses 
 on offering developers who are native English speakers and 
 interested in traditional Chinese culture an original database 
 to add to their project, forming an mysterious beauty from 
 ancient China. 



### How does this repository work?
The repository is written in json format, and organized the
document tree like dynasties-poets-works. By the way,<b> 
repository is still constructing.  </b>

##### An vivid example:
```json
[
    {
    "English":{
      "title":"Home-Coming",
      "dynasty":"Tang",
      "author": "He Zhizhang",
      "content":[
      "Oh, I return to the homeland I left while young,",
      "Thinner has grown my hair, though I speak the same tongue.",
      "My children, whom I meet, do not know who am I,",
      "Where are you from, dear sir?\" they ask with beaming eyes."
      ]
      },
      
      
    "Chinese":{
      "title":"回乡偶书",
      "dynasty":"唐",
      "author":"贺知章",
      "content":[
      "少小离家老大回，",
      "乡音无改鬓毛衰。",
      "儿童相见不相识，",
      "笑问客从何处来。"
      ],
      
     "tags": [
     "homesick"
     ]
    }
     
    }
 ]
